  ðŸ‘‹ **About Me**

  Iâ€™m an AI researcher and data scientist obsessed with turning ideas once thought *impossible* into working systems.

  From cutting-edge RAG pipelines to RLHF-tuned models that reason, fact-check, and create safely, I build AI that actually works in the messy, unpredictable real world.

  Iâ€™ve delivered solutions for research labs, startups, and academic teams slashing manual workloads by up to 90% and hitting over 95% accuracy on problems most people said couldnâ€™t be automated.

  To me, science and magic have always been the same thing: the thrill of making something new exist. That same curiosity led me to co-found and build an entire e-commerce platform from scratch proof that I donâ€™t just study systems, I build them, end to end.

  These days, I bring that builderâ€™s mindset to AI research across healthcare, education, storytelling, and social impact.

  Iâ€™m driven by a simple belief: the future isnâ€™t something we wait for; itâ€™s something we create. And Iâ€™m here to make sure the AI we build serves humanityâ€™s best ideas while inspiring the next generation of creators.

      description:
        "This tool transforms any book into a personalized, interactive mindmap summary based on the user's specific learning goals. \n\n**Motivation:** As an avid reader and visual learner, I struggled to efficiently absorb dense books for exams using traditional summaries. I needed a way to see the hierarchical structure of information to improve retention and accelerate my learning. I built this app to solve that problem.\n\n**Challenge & Solution:** Since the app works using only a book's title (no PDF or text input) the primary challenge was generating an accurate and coherent summary purely from the LLM's latent knowledge. I engineered an iterative, multi-step generation process to solve this: the AI first outlines the book, then elaborates on each point. A second challenge was ensuring consistent Markmap syntax. I solved this with a multi-shot prompt strategy and a validation layer that retries failed requests, achieving a >95% success rate.\n\n**Key Features:** The app generates editable, multi-layered mindmaps, providing a dynamic way to explore ideas. It supports multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek) for user flexibility.",

        "An AI-powered engine that answers user questions by analyzing the video transcripts of a YouTube channel, acting as an expert that has watched every video for you. \n\n**Motivation:** I built this after seeing my friends struggle to keep up with their favorite content creators. They wanted first-hand information without watching hours of video or relying on biased summaries from blogs. This tool gives them direct, instant access to the knowledge within the content.\n\n**Challenge & Solution:** The core challenge was extracting precise, trustworthy answers from a vast library of video transcripts. My solution is a multi-stage RAG pipeline: \n1. **Efficient Retrieval:** To handle the bulk content and manage API costs, I used ChromaDB to index transcripts. This allows the system to retrieve only the most semantically relevant text chunks for a given query. \n2. **Verification & Accuracy:** To ensure trust, the initial answer from the transcript is automatically cross-referenced against live web data, double-checking its accuracy and providing a more reliable response. \n3. **Enhanced Search:** I also implemented a multi-query retriever which uses an LLM to rephrase the user's question, overcoming phrasing mismatches and significantly improving search relevance.",

As a founder, I built the entire system from scratch, simultaneously learning and implementing each technology required to launch our direct retail channel. My goal was to own the full customer journey and leverage data to create a competitive advantage.\n\n**Hybrid Recommender:** To solve the classic 'cold start' problem, I engineered a hybrid recommender system. It combines content-based filtering for new products with collaborative filtering for established ones, successfully increasing user engagement and sales.\n\n**Automated Insight Generation:** I built an NLP pipeline to automatically process customer reviews for sentiment and common themes.

Driven by the project's direct contribution to UK safety, I was motivated to employ innovative techniques to deliver a comprehensive and systematic analysis.\n\n**Methodology & Innovation:**\n1. **Proactive Data Sourcing:** Recognising the limitations of the provided data, I conducted independent, domain-specific research and integrated supplementary datasets I collected from the gov.uk website. Synthesising these two sources was the key that unlocked unprecedented insights.\n2. **Robust Data Pipeline:** The initial data was extremely messy. I built a robust cleansing pipeline in R to automate the merging and standardisation of dozens of inconsistent CSVs, ensuring complete data integrity for the analysis.\n3. **Advanced Visualisation:** The synthesised data enabled powerful visualisations, including animated monthly trends with `gganimate` and geospatial heatmaps, which clearly communicated the complex spatiotemporal patterns.",
